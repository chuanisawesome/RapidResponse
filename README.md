# RapidResponse

To ensure that Rapid Reponse work there are two main hardware components that you must have:

- Raspberry Pi 3B+ or higher (for this project we used a Raspberry Pi 4)
- Luxonis usb Camera that can be found [here](https://shop.luxonis.com/collections/usb) (the camera that we used for the project is the Oak-D pro)

Since we are using the Luxonis api there are software dependancy installations that is needed:
[Raspberry Pi OS](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/install/?highlight=raspberry%20pi#raspberry-pi-os)
The package can also be installed through PyPI [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/install/?highlight=raspberry%20pi#install-from-pypi)
